# GPU-ThetaStar
A repository for testing CUDA parallelisation on theta star path finding algorithm


# 🎯 Goals
 - ✅ Implement (not necessary in CUDA) a parametrized generator that can generate the required input for your algorithm. (python-script)
 - 🛠 Implement a sequential version of the method in C or C++, which will serve as a baseline for comparison.
 - Implement the parallel algorithm in CUDA using synchronous programming trying different memories standard memory transfer, pinned memory, and zero-copy memory.
 - Implement a version of the parallel algorithm in CUDA using the thrust library.
 - (BONUS) Implement a version that takes advantage of CUDA streaming.
 - Extensively test the different implementations, by generating random input and comparing the consistency of the results produced by the different implementations.
 - Perform an extensive performance analysis comparing the different implementations and the __scalability__ of these algorithms with different numbers of obstacles and map sizes. Highlight the pros and cons of each implementation.
 - Prepare a written report of what you have done and the achieved results
